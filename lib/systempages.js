This is the first page which users will see when coming to the wiki, unless they follow a link to a specific page. The wiki is a quick and simple way of sharing information between people.\n\n## Features\n\nWith your new wiki you can:\n* Easily add pages to store notes or any information\n* Anyone can edit pages so the information is easier to maintain\n* use the simple formatting to decorate your text whilst focusing on the content\n* Make use of !CouchDB features such as replication to allow users to take the wiki offline\n* Use macros to list and include page content\n* Create page templates to provide a quick starting point for new pages (any page with a name starting with !PageTemplate will become a template!) \n* You can view previous versions of a page using the history button (up at the top, on the right).\n* Upload files / attachments for a page. For example, you can upload a picture for your page.\n* Use Markdown!\n\n## Recent changes\n\nHere's what's new for this wiki.\n{recentChanges}\n\n{include:HelpOnGettingStarted}\n\n## Need more help?\n\nYou can get more help here [Help](#Help)",

You can put whatever you want on this page. As you edit pages, !TapirWiki will record your changes. You can use the page history to view previous versions of each page.\n\n### New page\n\nYou can create a new page by following a link to a [PageWhichDoesNotExist](#PageWhichDoesNotExist). For ease of use, a link to a page called [NewPage](#NewPage) is in the main navigation at the top of each page. \n\n### Help\n\nThere are a few other useful bits of help, and you can add your own as you go.\n{topic:HelpOn}\n\n### Advanced settings\n\nAdvanced settings for the wiki are stored in a document in Couch - the doc id is \"TAPIRWIKISETTINGS\". This sets the following:\n* The wiki name (e.g. TapirWiki)\n* The default page (e.g. [FrontPage](#FrontPage))\n* The default username for new / unknown users (e.g. Anon)\n* The pages which are linked to in the main navigation\n\nEdit this document (using Futon) to change these settings.

    "body": "## Macros\n\nMacros are functions you can call in a wiki page. There are a few simple macros in TapirWiki, this page tells you how to use them. Looking at this page will show each macro in use. If you edit the page, you will see how to call them so that you can use them in your own pages.\n\n### Using a macro\nTo use a macro, simply include it in the markup for your page. Try editing this page to see how the macros are invoked. The macros are contained in curly braces {macro} and some take an additional argument {macro:argument}\n\n#### Index\nThe index macro lists all pages in the wiki. The macro name is \"index\" and it takes no arguments. Use it as follows:\n{index}\n\n#### Topic List\nThe topic list macro finds all pages whose names begin with a given string. The macro name is \"topic\" and the argument is the first part of the page name which must match to be listed. For example, find all help pages in the Wiki:\n{topic:HelpOn}\n\n#### Recent Changes\nYou can provide a list of the 5 most recent page edits which have occurred using the recent changes macro. It's a nice one to include on your FrontPage so people know what's going on. The macro name is \"recentChanges\" and it takes no arguments. Use it as follows:\n{recentChanges}\n\n#### Includes\nYou can include the content from any page within the body of any other page. Use this macro to reduce duplication in your wiki. The macro name is \"include\" and the argument is the page name to include. For example, to include the Help page:\n{include:Help}\n\nIf the page you include cannot be found, you will get an error message and a link to the page. Following the link should enable you to edit the page.\n{include:PageWhichDoesNotExistYet}\n",

    "body": "## Help on replication\n\nAs of !TapirWiki 0.2, replication is supported through the wiki UI. However, it is disabled by default. Replication **needs testing and may contain bugs or simply not work as you expect**. Please let me know if this is the case by raising an issue at https://github.com/johnko/kanso-wiki/issues\n\n### Enable replication\n\nEnabling replication requires editing the TAPIRWIKISETTINGS document.\n\n* Open Futon (http://hostname:5984/_utils/)\n* Open the database containing your wiki (e.g. 'tapirwiki')\n* Open the TAPIRWIKISETTINGS document - this contains a number of settings for the wiki\n* change the 'replicationEnabled' field to true\n* change the 'replicationEndPoint' field to be a URL to the central node in your wiki (e.g. 'http://remotehost:5984/tapirwiki')\n* Save the changes to the document and refresh your wiki\n\nIf the changes are successful, a new \"Synchronise\" button should appear in the wiki navigation menu (top left). \n\nNote : The synchronise button will not be show if you are viewing the wiki from the URL of the replicationEndPoint. For example, if you are browsing the wiki at http://remotehost:5984/wiki, the button will not be shown.\n\n### How replication works\n\nThe replication in !TapirWiki is a thin layer over the support for replication provided by CouchDB. When you press the synchronise button, the following occurs:\n\n* The remote wiki's changes are replicated to your local wiki\n* Your local wiki's changes are replicated to the remote wiki\n\nReplication only transfers the latest version of any page, so if you have a page which you have edited a lot on one computer, the historic version of the pages will remain on that computer - only the latest will be synchronised.\n\n### Conflicts\n\nConflicts occur when two or more changes are made to the same wiki page on two different instances. Any conflicts which occur should be visible through the page history. You can view the conflicting edit form here, and if you wish this version to become the most recent again, you can simply edit from that point. ",
