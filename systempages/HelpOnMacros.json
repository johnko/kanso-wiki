{"body": "h2. Macros\n\nMacros are functions you can call in a wiki page. There are a few simple macros in TapirWiki, this page tells you how to use them. Looking at this page will show each macro in use. If you edit the page, you will see how to call them so that you can use them in your own pages.\n\nh3. Using a macro\nTo use a macro, simply include it in the markup for your page. Try editing this page to see how the macros are invoked. The macros are contained in curly braces {macro} and some take an additional argument {macro:argument}\n\nh4. Index\nThe index macro lists all pages in the wiki. The macro name is \"index\" and it takes no arguments. Use it as follows:\n{index}\n\nh4. Topic List\nThe topic list macro finds all pages whose names begin with a given string. The macro name is \"topic\" and the argument is the first part of the page name which must match to be listed. For example, find all help pages in the Wiki:\n{topic:HelpOn}\n\nh4. Recent Changes\nYou can provide a list of the 5 most recent page edits which have occurred using the recent changes macro. It's a nice one to include on your FrontPage so people know what's going on. The macro name is \"recentChanges\" and it takes no arguments. Use it as follows:\n{recentChanges}\n\nh4. Includes\nYou can include the content from any page within the body of any other page. Use this macro to reduce duplication in your wiki. The macro name is \"include\" and the argument is the page name to include. For example, to include the Help page:\n{include:Help}\n\nIf the page you include cannot be found, you will get an error message and a link to the page. Following the link should enable you to edit the page.\n{include:PageWhichDoesNotExistYet}\n", "edited_by": "Nobody", "edited_on": "Tue Nov 17 2009 21:25:51 GMT+0000 (BST)", "_id": "HelpOnMacros", "type": "page"}
